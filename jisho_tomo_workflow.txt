1. Export TSV from Jisho Tomo
2. Import into Anki, select Vocab Megadeck, changing 3rd field to Reading instead of Heisig keywords, select Allow HTML. Trying out "Update existing note when first field matches" so that if I already have the word, it gets updated and tagged with `overwritten` instead of silently ignored. Tag new cards with `add_keywords`.
4. Check `overwritten` tag for output
5. Run script oneoff_heisigkeywords_fromcards.py (Cmd + Shift + ;)
6. Check output in cards
7. Reschedule for tomorrow (or reposition to 0)
8. Clear favorites in Jisho Tomo
